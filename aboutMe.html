        <section data-testid="test-about-bio">
            <h2>My Bio (The Quick Pitch)</h2>
            <p>I'm a budding frontend developer, currently learning the ropes of modern web development. I love how a
                few lines of code can turn into a beautiful, interactive experience. I'm focusing on building a strong
                foundation in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript before diving deep into frameworks. It's tough, but
                seeing my code work is the best feeling!</p>
        </section>

        <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
            <h2>🚀 Goals in This Program</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Master responsive design so my sites look perfect on any device.</li>
                <li>Write clean, semantic, and highly accessible HTML.</li>
                <li>Understand complex CSS layouts (Flexbox and Grid still make my brain hurt sometimes 😅).</li>
                <li>Build a portfolio of projects that I'm genuinely proud of!</li>
            </ul>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence 😬</h2>
            <p>Right now, I'm least confident in **JavaScript asynchronous operations** (Promises, Async/Await). It
                feels like magic, and I need to spend more time really understanding the event loop and how to handle
                API data gracefully. Also, advanced **ARIA attributes** are still a bit foggy—I want to be sure I'm not
                just slapping them on without understanding their impact.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h3>📝 Note to Future Self (October 2026)</h3>
            <p>Hey there! I hope you're crushing it! Remember this feeling of confusion and struggle? That's how you
                learn. Don't stop building things, even if they're ugly at first. Keep that beginner's curiosity alive,
                and please, *please* tell me you've figured out how to center a div without Stack Overflow by now. You
                got this! 💪</p>
        </section>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I'm learning that web development is about more than just code; it's about problem-solving,
                collaboration, and constant learning. The <b>HNG</b> community aspect is awesome, and I'm looking
                forward to
                contributing more as I gain confidence.</p>
